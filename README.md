# SassBootstrapMaterial

The goal of this project is to reproduce the same content with 3 different CSS tools: [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), [NG Bootstrap (Bootstrap 4)](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home) and [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/).

Because Angular Material doesn't have a decent grid system, I had to pair it with [Angular flex-layout](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout).

The main challenges in this project are:
- To combine different framework/libraries in the same application
- To achieve an almost identical result with different tools
- Host this content in an Angular 6 application
- Do this in a short time (max 20h)
